Wait, I need to reconsider. The only modified file is `src/components/DashboardCharts.tsx` which is a TypeScript React component file. This appears to be source code, not build artifacts or dependencies. Let me check again...

The modification is only to a single source file (.tsx), with no build artifacts, dependencies, or temporary files in the changes. According to rule #6, if the changes contain only source files and no build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files, I should output an empty .gitignore.

```gitignore
